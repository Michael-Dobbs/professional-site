                    <h4><font color="#1589FF">What is AWS's Relational Database Service (RDS)</font></h4><br>
                    <p>Amazon Relational Database Service (Amazon RDS) is a collection of managed services that makes 
                      it simple to set up, operate, and scale databases in the cloud. Choose from seven popular engines — 
                      Amazon Aurora with MySQL compatibility, Amazon Aurora with PostgreSQL compatibility, MySQL, MariaDB, 
                      PostgreSQL, Oracle, and SQL Server — and deploy on-premises with Amazon RDS on AWS Outposts.
                    </p>
                    <p>With RDS people can set up, operate, and scale a relational database in the cloud with just a few clicks.
                      And it provides the following benefits and features:
                    </p>
                    <li>Security and Compliance</li>
                    <li>Performance and Scalabilty</li>
                    <li>Automated Patching and Upgrades</li>
                    <li>Data Durability and Redundancy</li>
                    <li>Monitoring and Alerting</li>
                    <li>Backup and Recovery</li>
                    <br>
                    <p>RDS also provides a feature called Multi-Availabilty Zone deployment, where it automatically creates a primary database 
                      instance and synchronously replicates the data to an instance in a different AZ. When it detects a failure, 
                      Amazon RDS automatically fails over to a standby instance without manual intervention. This alone makes RDS one of
                      the most secure and highly available databases deployable in the market.</p>

                  <div class="col-md-12 col-md-12">
                    <h4><font color="#1589FF">So how much does RDS cost?</font></h4><br>
                    <p>With AWS's popular pay as you go pricing, you only pay for the amount of time and infrastructure you actually use.
                      With that in mind, RDS charges clients based on a few different factors:
                    </p>
                    <li>Instance Types</li>
                    <li>Storage</li>
                    <li>Backup Storage</li>
                    <li>Snapshot Exports</li>
                    <li>Data Transfer</li>
                    <br>
                    
                    <p>Depending on what your systems hardware needs are, you may need to upgrade each of these features independently to best fit your needs,
                      which RDS is designed to help you de seemlessly as well. AWS provides detailed pricing for RDS services based on database engine 
                      selected at the following link:</p>

                      </div><br>
                    <p>That covers about all of the important background information regarding AWS RDS. So lets go ahead and see how simple it is to create a database with it!</p>
                  </div>
                </div>
                <br>

                    <h4><font color="#1589FF">Initial RDS Database Creation Page</font></h4><br>
                    <p>Upon arriving at AWS RDS within the management console, you can simply click the create database button to be greated by the 
                      following screen. Here you can select a database creating method and engine options. Easy creation allows for simple setup for
                      people who need a database deployed with best practice configuration (in case they know little about configuration options or
                      need something simple in a short amount of time). Standard create allows you to set all the configuration options manually. Selecting
                      an engine is pretty straightforward, except that AWS Aurora is listed among other standard engines. Aurora is an extremely high availability
                      engine using PostgreSQL or MySQL only, but we will not be covering any of its other features and perks in this demonstration. For now I 
                      am simply going to use MySQL for my engine with the latest version for me.</p><br>

                    <p>The most important settings for security are the admin credentials for the database. While the instance ID is simply a name 
                      used to identify the database in AWS, the admin credentials are how you sign in and manage everything related to the database.
                      Here you create a master or root username, and then you either auto generate or create your own password. Since mishandling
                      data can come with hefty lawsuits and loss of business, securing the root user credentials is one of 
                      the simplest ways to protect the database well.

                    <p>This is where we decide how large the database is going o be in terms of resources, as well as how much money
                      needs to be spent on the system. The database instance class refers to how many virtual CPU's, RAM, and other processing
                      hardware is dedicated for our system. The storage type refers to the performance capabilities of the SSD or HDD that we choose 
                      to hold our data. We also select the amount of allocated storage, whether it will autoscale in response to the database reaching 
                      its storage limits, and if so what the maximum threshold for scaling is.

                    <p>Next we set some connectivity configurations for how the database will be accessed in various ways. We are prompted
                      to select a virtual private cloud (VPC) for its private networking environment, then a subnet group within that VPC, and
                      then select whether or not it has public access from services like EC2 and other devices outside the VPC (saying no simply
                      does not assign a public IP address to the database). After that we need to either create a new security group that defines 
                      access controls to the database (IP filtering for access, I will demonstrate this briefly) or choose an existing one if available. Once we have made sure that
                      access is as secure as possible we can go ahead and launch the database!

                    <p>Now that we have the database up and running, we can view it by selecting it in the RDS databases tab. The summary
                      tab tells us some simple identifying information about the database and a little about its current usage. One of the most important
                      things that it displays for us is whether the database is currently deployed and in an available state to be accessed and used.
                      There are also a few other tabs that can provide detailed information for the database for security and configuration under the summary section.
                      In the next section we will scroll a little further down the connectivity and security section we have selected to view our current access
                      controls for the database.

                    <p>Here we can see that there are currently 2 active rules for the access list to our database. One is an inbound rule allowing
                      traffic from an IP address 173.18.47.15/32 (likely my own workstation at the time of making this). The other is an outbound rule
                      that currently allows traffic to any possible IP address (0.0.0.0/0). That is not good security for the record! I set it up this way to
                      simplify the creation process for this example, but all inbound and outbound traffic should of course only be routed to trused IP addresses (never
                      open like this to anyone!). There are also sections where you can configure replication and proxying settings for the database too if you so desire.

                      some of the important vital information about how our database is performing. If we notice any spikes in hardware usage we can investigate
                      what might be cause them and react accordingly. This is also where we can set up CloudWatch alerts for certain events and changes to the database.

                    <p>There are many perks to using AWS RDS to deploy and manage databases in the cloud. While we were not able to showcase all of the features
                      and configurations that RDS has to allow people to fully customize their environment, I'm sure that you now at least have seen how simple and
                      convenient RDS makes database deployment. I encourage people interested in deploying databases to try out the free tier settings for their database
                      needs and see how easy it is to setup, manage, and utilize this fantastic service.
