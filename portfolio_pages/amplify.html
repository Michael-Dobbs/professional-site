                    <p>Amplify is a cloud service from AWS that lets frontend web and mobile developers easily build, ship, and host 
                      full-stack applications on AWS, with the flexibility to leverage the breadth of AWS services as use cases evolve. 
                      No cloud expertise is needed to utilize AMplify, just unit tested code retrieved from a version control or pipeline source.</p>
                      <p>Route 53 on the other hand is a highly available and scalable Domain Name System (DNS) web service. 
                        It helps connects user requests to internet applications (with URL address resolution) running on AWS or on-premises.</p>

                    </div><br>
                    <p>So basically people can build websites and web applications very quickly and easily with Amplify, and then use Route 53
                      to connect highly available and secure domains and web addressing to them. The following demonstration will explain
                      the pricing of these products and then discuss how I used these services to create this website!

                    <h4><font color="#1589FF">What are the prices of Amplify and Route 53?</font></h4><br>
                    <p>Below shows some examples of what you would expect to pay in order to host an application with Amplify. Its actually suprisingly
                      cheap overall and has some great free tier options for the first 12 months of development and deployment. Route 53 pricing can 
                      be either very simply or complex depending on the hardware the domains are hworking with. For this simple use case its just a standard
                      domain registration charge of $13 for a year contract to own the site URL (meetmichaeldobbs.net), and then I pay $0.50 for every
                      extra hosted zone that makes the site have greater resolution speed and availability.

                    <p>Once you arrive at the Amplify page you can select to create a new application from the dashboard. You will then
                      be asked how you wish to have the code deployed, in my case I wish you it to be built off code from my Github repository.
                      Selecting source control will then prompt you to connect to a Git repository in order to pull the applications source code for building
                      and deploying the app.

                    <p>Once you have selected your source you will have to sign into that platform and give AWS Amplify permission to do pull
                      requests on the latest commits to that repository. Proper configuration of these permissions is an important part of
                      how Amplify will be able to make the application work, so even though this step is easy it is also very important.

                      within the repository that Amplify will build the application from (i.e. main, production, development, etc.). It
                      also promts you to check the permissions again because as I stated previously, it will not build properly without
                      them.

                      My application is quite simple so I do not need to make any changes here or in the advanced settings for builds, but the
                      larger and more complex the application is the more configuration you may want or need. Once you are done with these settings,
                      you can review and create the application and return to the applications page.

                      I have linked the application to my own domain (I will demonstrate this next). We can also view important information about the last build
                      and deployment to make sure that everything is updating correctly when we make any changes. If I do change the source code in the repository with
                      any commits, Amplify will immediately pull the new code, build it, and deploy it while never taking the application offline. The whole
                      process only takes my application about 30-60 seconds, but for larger applications it might takes minutes.

                    <p>In order to connect and manage any domains that route to your application (such as URL's purchased on Route 53) you need to click the
                      domain management tab on the left side of the screen. This will allow you to add new domains and manage the current ones, although a
                      default domain through amplify is connected to the application if you wish to use it (its not pretty though). It is also important to note that
                      domains purchased through Route 53 will have one click integration to setup SSL certification for your domain (making it HTTPS and not HTTP, which
                      is more secure and people trust it more). Other domain services may be able to do this with a bit more complication, but some cant manage to do it at all (i.e. Go Daddy
                      cannot generate HTTPS SSL certificates with amplify). Choose your domain registration platform wisely and  remember that AWS products will always be
                      able to comminicate with each other faster and easier than external providers.

                      are minimal. There are a ton of other features that Amplify has for developing frontend user interfaces and backend environment management as well, so
                      I encourage developers to give it a shot and see what they think of the service. If you need to make a simple static website like this one for whatever reason,
                      then Amplify is perfect, lightning fast, free or cheap to use, and made so that no cloud expertise is needed. By using Route 53 with it we also get to maximize
                      site availability and seemlessly intergrate security into our applications.
